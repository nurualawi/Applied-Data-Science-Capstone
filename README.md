# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This project was completed as the final assignment of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. It involves analyzing real-world data to draw insights, build predictive models, and present findings in a meaningful way.

## 📊 Project Overview

The main goal was to identify trends, clean and process data, and build a data pipeline that supports machine learning and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- SQL (for data extraction and transformation)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

## 📈 Key Deliverables

- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis and insights
- Visualizations that tell a story
- Predictive modeling (basic machine learning)
- GitHub integration for version control and sharing

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to apply data science techniques to real-world datasets  
- Communicating findings through visual storytelling  
- Version control and collaboration with GitHub
